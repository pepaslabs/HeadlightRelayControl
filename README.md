# HeadlightRelayControl
A circuit board to control automotive headlight relays.

## How this circuit was designed

### Background: The need for this circuit

#### Why did I make this circuit?

After upgrading the aging, dim headlights on my pickup truck with an HID headlight kit from eBay, I ran into a problem: the stock headlight switch couldn't handle the higher current load of the HID headlights.

#### Why did the stock headlight switch fail?  Its hard to beleive the HIDs drew THAT MUCH more current...
